Professor,

My final project is deployed on the AWS/AMI EC2. The IP address is 52.24.87.201:3000

I have tested this deployed final project on safari, firefox, and IE using either general or private mode. I have tested with using chrome, so far the general mode works fine, however private browsing(incognito) sometimes report nil class error, which I believe caused by the session setting under incognito mode. I would try fixing this before submission.

Thank you.
